Basic UNet based on https://towardsdev.com/original-u-net-in-pytorch-ebe7bb705cc7

Vision GNN implemented from architecture proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00272

UNet3+ CAMUS code based on released in https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08790

My final model uses modified skip connections from UNet3+ as well as ViG blocks modified from code released from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.

All final model code for processing datasets, segmentation, training, and base architecture is my own. I included the above references as they were used as a starting point for my work and I used them heavily at the beginning of my research to get an idea of typical performance on the CAMUS dataset.
